to enable use of github actions do the following:

1- go to settings page -> actions -> general -> workflow permissions - enable "read and write permissions"

2- in the pages section -> build and deployment -> set source to "github actions"

3- push update to repo using git

currently working on a file viewer for repo that's updated with every change/push, the active incarnation is made via GLM-4.6
